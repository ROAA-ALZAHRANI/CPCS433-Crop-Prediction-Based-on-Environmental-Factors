# CPCS433-Crop-Prediction-Based-on-Environmental-Factors
This project is designed to determine the optimal environmental conditions for
 cultivating specific crops, ensuring they are planted in their ideal habitats. Through
 the implementation of the Crop Prediction Dataset, the project utilizes machine
 learning techniques to forecast crop yields based on various environmental factors,
 including temperature, humidity, pH, and water availability. By accurately predict
ing crop outcomes, the project aims to guide farmers in selecting the most suitable
 environments for different crops, facilitating cultivation in their optimal conditions.
 This predictive approach contributes to informed decision-making in agriculture,
 promoting the cultivation of crops in environments that maximize yield and overall
 productivity. This project employs algorithms such as LSTM, ANN, SVM, and
 Decision trees. The effects of all four algorithms are evaluated with several met
rics, including Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score. The results show that the
 LSTM model outperformed all the other models with an accuracy of 98.28%.
